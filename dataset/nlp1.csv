For example, to numerically integrate a function of an N-dimensional vector with a grid of 10 points in each dimension would require the evaluation of 10 points, which is far too many to be computed.Monte Carlo methods provide a way out of this exponential time increase: as long as the function is reasonably well behaved, it can be estimated by randomly selecting points in N-dimensional space and then taking an appropriate average of the function values at these points.

MMM takes into account a pedestrian's personality as an unobservable parameter. It also takes into account the effects of the pedestrian's previous status. A promotional experiment in a major shopping mall demonstrated that the highest prediction accuracy of the MMM method is 74.4%. In comparison with methods based on a Markov-chain model (MM) and a hidden-Markov model (HMM) (i.e., prediction rates of about 45% and 2%, respectively), the proposed MMM-based prediction method is substantially more accurate. This pedestrian-movement prediction based on MMM using tracking data will make it possible to provide so-called ""adaptive mobile services"" with proactive functions.",,,

It identifies one case inwhich the special structure of the automata that are constructed allows alinear-time determinization procedure to be used.

In this paper, we present a new approach for robust MPC synthesis that allows explicit incorporation of the description of plant uncertainty in the problem formulation. The uncertainty is expressed in both the time and frequency domains. The goal is to design, at each time step, a state-feedback control law that minimizes a 'worst-case' infinite horizon objective function, subject to constraints on the control input and plant output. Using standard techniques, the problem of minimizing an upper bound on the 'worst-case' objective function, subject to input and output constraints, is reduced to a convex optimization involving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown that the feasible receding horizon state-feedback control design robustly stabilizes the set of uncertain plants. Several extensions, such as application to systems with time delays, problems involving constant set-point tracking, trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection, which follow naturally from our formulation, predictive control; linear matrix inequalities: convex optimization; multivariable control systems: state-feedback; on-line operation; robust control; robust stability; time-varying systems.

This is motivated by two previous techniques. One is the well-known robust MPC that parameterizes the infinite horizon control moves into a single linear state feedback law. The other is a nominal on-line MPC that splits the in6nite horizon control moves into a setof free control moves over a fixed horizon and a state feedback law in the terminal region. The basic idea here is to adopt the rationale of the second technique to improve feasibility and optimality of the first one. A parameter-dependent lyapunov function is developed for establishing the closed-loop stability.

In this control scheme, a neural network is connected in parallel with the MPC controller and trained on- line by minimizing the MPC controller output corresponding to the unmodeled effect. It is applied to distillation column control and nonlinear reactor control to illustrate its effectiveness. The result shows that the neural feedforward controller can cope well with strong interactions, time delays, nonlinearities, and process/ model mismatch. The controller also offers such advantages as fault tolerance, generalization capability by interpolation, and learning capability by random input patterns. ",,,

One strategy for improving the com-putational performance is to formulate MPC using a linear program. While the linear programming formulation seems appealingfrom a numerical standpoint, the controller does not necessarily yield good closed-loop performance. In this work, we explore MPC.

In general, the AGV is a large mobile robot that is used in transportation to carry cargoes, and it is guided using wired or wireless guidance systems.The guidance system based AGV accounts for a majority of robots in the mobile robot industry. However, in semiconductor factories, landmarks are unavailable; hence, the existing system has not been used in the mentioned environments. Therefore, the SLAM technology is applied in the environments, and can guide the AGV without landmarks. However, the accuracy of the SLAM can be low owing to measurement error of sensors and a cumulative calculation caused by localization sensors. Therefore, the accuracy is frequently assumed to be incorrect; moreover, the accuracy of thebuilt map is low. In order to solve the problems, this study proposes the AGV with the SLAM basedon matching methods; two matching method; geometric matching method and iterative closest point algorithm.The performance of the proposed method is compared with typical methods such as singular value decomposition/RIGID transformation based technologies using feature-point-based SLAM and is compared with the aforementioned two methods using the extended Kalman filter",,,
