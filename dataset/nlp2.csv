Thena brief review of the so called ""quasi-Monte Carlo"" integrationmethod along with its advantages is given. Such an approach isthen applied to compute numerically Pollaczek expressions. Comparison between our numerical procedure and an algorithm thathas already been published proves both the procedure accuracy,one of its main advantages along with its ease of implementation,and its relatively low time consumption, independent of the inputparameters.

For example, deterministic methods of numerical integration operate by taking several evenly spaced samples from a function. While this might work well for functions of one variable,such methods can be very inefficient for functions of several variables. For example, to numerically integrate a function of an N-dimensional vector with a grid of 10 points in each dimension would require the evaluation of 10 points, which is far too many to be computed.Monte Carlo methods provide a way out of this exponential time increase: as long as the function is reasonably well behaved, it can be estimated by randomly selecting points in N-dimensional space and then taking an appropriate average of the function values at these points.

So, akin to HMC,PMC allows one to restore hidden stochastic processes, with numerous applications to signal and image processing, such as speech recognition, image segmentation, and symbol detection or classification, among others. Furthermore,we propose an original method of parameter estimation, which generalizes the classical Iterative Conditional Estimation (ICE) valid for of classical hidden Markovchain model, and whose extension to possibly non-Gaussian and correlated noise is briefly treated.

Elementary textures are characterized by their spatial interactions with neighboring regions along selected directions. Such interactions are modeled, in turn, by means of a set of Markov chains, one for each direction, whose parameters are collected in a feature vector that synthetically describes thetexture. Based on the feature vectors, the texture are then recursively merged, giving rise to larger and more complex textures,which appear at different scales of observation: accordingly, the model is named Hierarchical Multiple Markov Chain.The Texture Fragmentation and Reconstruction(TFR) algorithm,addresses the unsupervised segmentation problem based on the H-MMC model. The ""fragmentation"" step allows one to find the elementary textures of the model, while the ""reconstruction"" step defines the hierarchical image segmentation based on a probabilistic measure (texture score) which takes into account both region scale and inter region interactions.

This paper describes a method for statistical testing based on a Markov chain model of software usage. The significance of the Markov chain is two fold. First, it allows test input sequences to be generated from multiple probability distributions, making it more general than many existing techniques. Analytical results associated with Markov chains facilitate informative analysis of the sequences before they are generated, indicating how the test is likely to unfold. Second, the test input sequences generated from the chain and applied to the software are themselves a stochastic model and are used to create a second Markov chain to encapsulate the history of the test, including any observed failure information. The influence of the failures is assessed through analytical computations on this chain. We also derive a stopping criterion for the testing process based on a comparison of the sequence generating properties of the two chains.

This paper treats a linear network topology,where the nodes form a one dimensional horizontal grid with equal spacing. In this OLA approach, all nodes are intended to decode and relay. Therefore, the method has potential application as a high-reliability and low-latency approach for broadcasting in a line-shaped network, or unicasting along a pre-designated route. We derive the transition probability matrix of the Markov chain based on the hypoexponential distribution of the received power at a given time instant assuming that all the nodes have equal transmit power and the channel has Rayleigh fading and path loss with an arbitrary exponent. The state is represented as a ternary word, which indicates which nodes have decoded inthe present hop, in a previous hop, or have not yet decoded.

This paper presents a cyber attack detection technique through anomaly detection, and discusses the robustness of the modeling technique employed. In this technique,a Markov-chain model represents a profile of computer event transitions in a normal/usual operating condition of a computer and network system (a norm profile). The Markov chain model of the norm profile is generated from historic data of the system's normal activities. The observed activities of the system are analyzed to infer the probability that the Markov-chain modelof the norm profile supports the observed activities. The lowerprobability the observed activities receive from the Markov-chainmodel of the norm profile, the more likely the observed activitiesare anomalies resulting from cyber-attacks, and vice versa. Thispaper presents the learning and inference algorithms of this anomaly detection technique based on the Markov-chain model of a norm profile, and examines its performance using the audit data of UNIX-based host machines with the Solar is operating system.The robustness of the Markov-chain model for cyber attack detection is presented through discussions & applications.

For a horizon of five and a three-level inverter, forexample, the computational burden is reduced by four orders ofmagnitude, compared to the standard exhaustive search approach.This paper illustrates the performance gains that are achievable by using prediction horizons larger than one.

A well-known technique for implementing fast MPC is to compute the entire control law offline, in which case the on-line controller can be implemented as a lookup table. This method works well for systems with small state and input dimensions (say,no more than five), few constraints, and short time horizons. In this paper, we describe a collection of methods for improving the speedof MPC, using online optimization. These custom methods, which exploit the particular structure of the MPC problem, can compute the control action on the order of 100 times faster than a method that uses a generic optimizer. As an example, our method computes the control actions for a problem with 12 states, 3 controls,and horizon of 30 time steps (which entails solving a quadratic pro-gram with 450 variables and 1284 constraints) in around 5 ms, allowing MPC to be carried out at 200 Hz.Model predictive control (MPC), real-time convexoptimization."

To suppress the parameter mismatch disturbances effectively, this paper proposes a modified MPCC with a current variation update mechanism. In contrast with the traditional current prediction equation that contains crude model parameters, the modified current prediction equation contains only measured information, taking advantage of the proposed current variation update mechanism, which can update the modified prediction equation within each sampling period.

However,being based on local iterative optimization, ICP is known to be susceptible to local minima. Its performance critically relies on thequality of the initialization and only local optimality is guaranteed. This paper presents the first globally optimal algorithm, named Go-ICP, for Euclidean (rigid) registration of two 3D point sets under the L2 error metric defined in ICP. The Go-ICP method is based on a branch-and-bound (BnB) scheme that searches the entire 3D motion spaceSE. By exploiting the special structure of geometry, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for the registration error function. Local ICP is integrated into the BnB scheme, which speeds up the new method while guaranteeing global optimality. We also discuss extensions, addressing the issue of outlier robustness. The evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method is able to produce reliable registration results regardless of the initialization.

This drift can be corrected using exteroceptive sensors such as laser scanners via a scene registration proce-dure. For this procedure the common assumption of high pointcloud overlap is violated when the scenario and the robot's point-of-view are not static and the sensor's field-of-view (FOV) is limited. In this paper we focus on the localization of a robot with limited FOV in a semi-structured environment. We analyze the effect of overlap variations on registration performance and demonstrate that where overlap varies, outlier filtering needs to be tuned accordingly. We define a novel parameter which gives a measure of this overlap. In this context, we propose a strategy for robust non-incremental registration. The pre-filtering module selects planar macro features from the input clouds, discarding clutter. Outlier filtering is automatically tuned at run-time to allow registration to a common reference in conditions of non-uniform overlap. An extensive experimental demonstration is presented which characterizes the performance of the algorithm using two humanoids: theNASA Valkyrie, in a laboratory environment, and the BostonDynamics Atlas, during the DARPA Robotics Challenge Finals."
